# Ìª°Ô∏è Zuban-e-Niazi: The Tribal Code of Conduct

In our culture, a man is defined by his **Zuban** (Word) and his **Ghairat** (Honour). This platform is not a social media site; it is a digital Hujra. By contributing to this repository, you agree to uphold these five pillars:

### I. Pat (Respect for Ancestors)
We do not treat our ancestors as data points. Every name in this silsila represents a life of dignity. 
* Disagreements over lineage will not be handled through public "Issues" or "Pull Requests." 
* If a node is uncertain, we honor the mystery rather than inventing a lie.

### II. Siali (Equality of Clans)
The Niazi tribe is a vast ocean. Whether a family belongs to the Khans of Isa Khel, the Maliks of Mochh, or the Sarhangs of the city, all are equal in blood. 
* No Khel is superior to another. 
* Any attempt to use this tree to establish "superiority" will result in immediate removal.

### III. Parda-e-Namus (Family Privacy)
Following our tribal custom, the sanctity of the household is absolute.
* **Strict Rule:** No names or details of the women (*Parda-nasheen*) of the tribe shall be recorded in this public repository. 
* We record the male lineage to preserve the Silsila, while respecting the Parda of our homes.

### IV. Nang (Honesty in Lineage)
A "clean gap" in a tree is more honorable than a "painted lie." 
* If the link to an ancestor from 200 years ago is oral and unproven, we categorize it under the **Silsila-e-Gumnaam** (The Hidden Lineage). 
* We do not fabricate connections to gain status.

### V. Rogha (Conflict Resolution)
In case of a dispute over tribal history:
1. Do not engage in public debate.
2. The lead maintainer will act as the *Jirga* coordinator.
3. Historical "Truth" will be decided by consensus of elders, not by whoever writes the most code.
