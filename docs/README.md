# Ìª°Ô∏è Niazi Silsila (The Niazi Connection)

**Preserving the Legacy of the Niazi Tribe through Honour, not just Data.**

This project is a long-term initiative to create a digital home for the Niazi tribe (specifically focusing on the hubs of **Mochh**, **Isa Khel**, and **Mianwali**). 

Unlike traditional genealogy sites, this project follows the **"Zuban-e-Niazi"**‚Äîa code of conduct that prioritizes tribal Ghairat (Honour) and privacy over raw data collection.

## Ìøπ The Vision
We aim to bridge the "200-year gap" in our history by connecting modern families to their ancient tribal roots without forcing unproven links. 

* **The Root:** Honoring our undisputed ancestors (Lodi/Niazaey).
* **The Leaf:** Allowing living families to map their known heritage.
* **The Bridge:** Respecting the "Era of Silence" where records are oral.

## Ì¥ù The Social Contract (Zuban)
All contributors and users must adhere to the tribal code:
1. **Respect (Pat):** No public debates over lineage accuracy.
2. **Equality (Siali):** All Khels (clans) are equal.
3. **Privacy (Parda):** No information on the women of the tribe (*Namus*).
4. **Honesty (Nang):** Better a clean gap than a painted lie.
