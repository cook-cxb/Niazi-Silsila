# í¼³ Tree Philosophy: The Root, Leaf, and Cluster Approach

Traditional genealogy fails in tribal societies because it demands "Proof of Node" for eras where only "Oral Truth" exists. To avoid the **Fitna** (discord) of debating ancestors from 200 years ago, this project uses a **Bottom-Up Cluster Model**.

## 1. The Structure

### í½ƒ The Leaves (Bottom-Up)
We begin with the living. Every tribesman is encouraged to map what he knows for certain: **Himself âž” Father âž” Grandfather âž” Great-Grandfather.** This is the "Leaf" level. It is verified by the living family and is the foundation of our current identity.

### íºµ The Root (Top-Down)
We acknowledge the undisputed tribal progenitors: **Niazaey âž” Khaku/Bahi/Jamal âž” The Clan Heads (e.g., Taja Khan).** This is the "Root." It provides the historical canopy under which we all sit.

### í¼«ï¸ The Bridge: Dastaan-e-Gumnaam (The Hidden Legacy)
Between the "Roots" (16th/17th Century) and our "Leaves" (late 19th Century) lies a gap of roughly 150-200 years. Instead of forcing a link and causing arguments, we designate this space as:
> **"Dastaan-e-Gumnaam: The Era of Ancestors whose names are with Allah, but whose blood is in our veins."**

By using this term, we acknowledge that a gap in the tree is not a gap in the lineage. It is a space of respect where we refuse to guess.

## 2. The Cluster System (The "Hujra" Node)
Instead of a single vertical line, we group families into **Clusters** based on their **Khel** and **Village**.
* **Identity over Accuracy:** A user identifies as "Taja Khel from Mochh." 
* They are "pinned" to the Mochh Cluster. 
* They can see other families in that cluster.
* They are connected to the "Root" through their Clan identity, even if the specific "Father-to-Son" line from the year 1820 is currently Gumnaam (Hidden).

## 3. Rules of Engagement
1. **No Forced Links:** Do not attempt to connect your "Leaf" to a "Root" unless you have a documented Sanad or a consensus of tribal elders.
2. **Acceptance of the Gap:** The "Dastaan-e-Gumnaam" is a valid part of the tree. It is not "missing data"; it is a historical reality.
3. **Identity over Ego:** We connect to the **Tribe** first, and the **Lineage** second.
