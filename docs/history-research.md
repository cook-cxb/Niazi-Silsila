# í³œ Historical Context: The Niazi Frontier

## The Origins
The Niazi tribe are a branch of the Lodi Pashtuns. Our history is one of migration, martial prowess, and the transition from the mountains of Afghanistan to the banks of the Indus. While we are part of the larger Pashtun family, the Niazi identity is uniquely tied to the soil of **Mianwali**.

## The Mianwali Settlements
Historically, the Niazi expansion into the Indus plains involved the displacement of the Gakhar dynasties. This was not merely a conquest of land, but the establishment of a tribal sanctuary. 

### Key Cultural Hubs:
* **Mochh:** The central stronghold of the **Taja Khel**. Mochh remains the "conservative soul" of the tribe, where the traditional Malik culture and ancestral lands have been preserved with the greatest intensity.
* **Isa Khel:** The seat of the Khans. This region represents the political and "royal" history of the tribe, having engaged with empires and modern states for centuries.
* **The Martial Tradition:** From the cavalry of Sher Shah Suri (led by Haibat Khan Niazi) to the modern Pakistan Army, the Niazi history is inseparable from military service. Land was often held not just through farming, but as a "Sanad" (reward) for the lives given in battle.

## Research Objectives
This project seeks to document:
1. The migration routes of the major Khels (Jamal, Bahi, Khaku).
2. The settlement patterns along the Indus.
3. The preservation of the Niazi dialect and oral codes of honor.
